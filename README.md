# üé® About this theme
This VSCode theme is all about simplicity and tranquility. It's inspired by the peaceful aesthetics of [Horizon Theme by jolaleye](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), offering a relaxed coding experience with a muted color palette.
<br/><br/>
In this theme, we've taken a unique approach by significantly reducing the vibrant violets present in the original theme and replaced them with calming shades of gray.

### 1. Import cost
If you use [Wix's Import Cost extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) to keep track of the size of your imports, consider adding this configuration to your VSCode user settings JSON:
```
  "importCost.smallPackageDarkColor": "#c6c6c624",
  "importCost.mediumPackageDarkColor": "#c6c6c624",
  "importCost.smallPackageLightColor": "#c6c6c624",

### 2. Icon Pack
To complement your theme, we recommend using an icon pack for your file icons. We suggest the "[vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)" icon pack, which pairs beautifully with our theme. You can install it from the [VSCode extensions marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons).

### 3. Bracket Pair Colorization
Ensure that your bracket pair colorization configuration is disabled as well.

  "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false
